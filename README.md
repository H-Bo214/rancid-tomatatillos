### Abstract

This was a paired project that was designed to display movie information. In this project, we designed an interactive web page for users view a collection of movies and their details. A user will be able to favorite movies, comment on movies, submit a rating for a specific movie. The user is also able to view their comments and comments made by different users. The user also has the ability to delete a prior rating.

This project will demonstrate our understanding and implementation of React class based and functional components, props, state, testing suites, HTML/CSS UX/UI design, ability to write modular, reusable code that follows SRP, JSX and the ability to follow spec/comp to complete a functional app.

## Technologies / Systems
* React
* Javascript
* JSX
* git/Version control
* React testing library
* CSS
* React Router

## Learning Goals ##

* Solidify React fundamentals
* Solidify using React Router to create a multi-page user experience
* Solidify component and asynchronous JS testing
* Work with and navigate a shared, persistent API using GET, POST, and DELETE requests

## Planning: ##
 
The paired project was created using vscode. We used gitHub projects to manage issue cards and the project board. We consulted the Turing lessons, peers and mentors as well as the MDN Docs and various responses to google searches for support when needed.
 
## Challenges ##
 
* This was our introduction to React, so that in itself presented challenges.
* asyncronous functions
  
## Wins ##
  
* Successfully utilizing the React library to populate our application with the data
